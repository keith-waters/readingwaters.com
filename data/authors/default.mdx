Hi there! I'm Keith. This place is where I write down my thoughts related to coding (the computer kind) and business (also the computer kind). 

# A few fun facts:
- I've been working as a web developer/software developer since 2017
- I have a degree in Outdoor Recreation (and not any type of CS degree)
- I've rowed the entire Grand Canyon in a raft
