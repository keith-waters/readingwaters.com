## #1 Foundational knowledge
I want to have a more foundational knowledge of Software Engineering and Computer Science. 

Part of diving into more "Foundational Knowledge" involves learning how things work. Thins like HTTP, Networking, Operation Systems, Kernels, Command Lines, V8 engine, JavaScript, and more and more and more. The C language binds all of those together.

## #2 A lot of things are build in C
Those things are either built in C or interface with C libraries. The Linux kernel is built in C. My thinking is, to lubricate the learning about all of these concepts, at least be able to read C and write some C.

## #3 It's hard
It's hard. It doesn't have a lot of the niceties that newer languages have. There are no classes, you cannot pass arrays as function params, there are no strings!

## #4 Stop procrastinating
I constantly procrastinate learning a thing in order to make sure I'm learning the RIGHT thing. Learning C is just to get started this go round. No need to roil and toil to pick the right thing. Gotta start somewhere.

## #5 It's fun!
I like building things and tinkering on projects. C will give me another tool to work with. üòÅ
