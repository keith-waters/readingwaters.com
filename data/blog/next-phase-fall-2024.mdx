Next up in ReadingWaters land, I'm going to make tutorials and how-to's on coding and computer science stuff!

I'm going through a phase of where I want to get better and grow as a Software Engineer. So, I'm going to triple down and write about what I know and what I'm learning to improve.

Yes, I'll likely dip into the Indiehacker scene and still make projects. Or try and get some side project to make money. 

The idea is to focus on learning and remembering what I've learned.
