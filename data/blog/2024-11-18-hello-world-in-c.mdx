# Requirements
- Mac computer
- Xcode installed
- Text editor
- Familiarity with the command line

I'm doing this on a MacBook Pro that I already use for web development. All of the commands and code will be written with that in mind.

# Writing the program

Open your terminal and navigate to a directory you want to work in. I made mine in `/readingwaters/projects/c-lang-fun` 

Once there, you'll want to make the file that holds your code. You can do this by running:
```
touch helloworld.c
```

Now the file is made open it up in your favorite text editor.

Then put in code that looks like this:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Lets walk through that line by line

- `#include <stdio.h>` brings in the header file so we can use `printf` below
- `int main() {` sets the return type to integer and defines our main function 
- `printf("Hello, World!\n");` will print the `"Hello, World!\n"` string (technically a character array) to standard out, the terminal in our case
- `return 0;` fulfills our functions return type
- `}` closes our function

# Compiling the program
`clang` is C compiler that you can use from the command line. There are a ton of them and if you are just starting out, like I am, don't worry about which one too much.

If you have Xcode installed on your Mac, should already have `clang`. You can check by running: 
```
clang -v
```

When I run it it gives me:
```
Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin23.2.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

Do I know what all that means? Nope. It does tell me I have `clang` installed though ðŸ˜…

To compile `helloworld.c` all you have to run is 
```
clang helloworld.c
```

That should create another file in the same directory called `a.out`

# Running your Hello World program
With `helloworld.c` compiled to `a.out` all you need to do is run `a.out`! You can do this by running:
```
./a.out
```

You should get some thing like:
```
Hello, World!
```

Huzzah! You did it! A Hello World program in C!
