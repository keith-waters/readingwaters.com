## First Idea: Yet Another Link Shortener!

Yep, you got it. I'm making a link shortener. 

I forget how I landed on this idea. But I've been thinking about it for a while now and really want to build one. There are tons of them out there, which means lots of examples and endless feature ideas!

Another reason I like it is the basic premise is simple: take one link and redirect it to another. Which is right in line with the 3 projects in 3 months goal. <Link href={"/notes/3-projects-in-3-months"}><a>(You can check out the other goals here.)</a></Link>

My hope is to start small and then be able to iterate on it.

Initial scope will be: 
- User can sign up
- User can pay for the subscription
- User can create a shortened link
- User can view all their shortened links in a dashboard

Some stretch goals are:
- edit/delete links in dashboard
- a CRUD API to interact with the software
- custom domains for the short link
- some metrics, at least click counts
- ???

If you have any other ideas, let me know on Twitter!
